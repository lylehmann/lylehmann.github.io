Yola Santos, the creative force behind Azulverdoso, is a talented artist based in Mexico who specializes in decorative ceramic works and the restoration of objects. Her artistic vision combines traditional Mexican craftsmanship with contemporary design, resulting in pieces that are both functional and visually striking.

As part of the Cimdata further education program in UX and UI design, I contributed to creating a digital presence for Azulverdoso, Yola Santos' artisanal ceramics and restored objects brand.

## The Challenge

Azulverdoso faced several challenges due to its limited online presence:

- Lack of a dedicated website, relying solely on Facebook for online visibility
- Limited ability to showcase the full range of artisanal ceramics and restored objects
- Absence of an online sales platform for reaching a broader customer base

## Design Process

1. **Research:** Analyzed Azulverdoso's existing Facebook presence, studied competitor websites in the artisanal ceramics market, conducted business interview with Yola Santos to understand potential business needs

2. **Ideation:** Created mood boards to capture Azulverdoso's aesthetic, sketched initial concepts for website layout and functionality

3. **Prototyping:** Utilized Adobe XD to create low-fidelity wireframes, developed mid-fidelity prototypes for key pages and features, designed high-fidelity mockups incorporating Azulverdoso's brand colors and typography

4. **Testing:** We gathered feedback from Yola Santos to ensure alignment with brand vision, iterated on designs based on user and stakeholder input

## Key Features

- Visually appealing **homepage** showcasing featured ceramic pieces
- **Online gallery** to display the full range of Azulverdoso products
- **E-commerce functionality** for direct sales of ceramics and restored objects
- **About page** highlighting Yola Santos' artistic process and brand story
- **Contact form and social media integration** for customer engagement
- **Responsive design** ensuring optimal viewing experience across devices

## Outcomes and Lessons Learned

- Created a user-friendly website that effectively showcases Azulverdoso's unique aesthetic
- Implemented an intuitive e-commerce solution to facilitate online sales

- Gained practical experience in using Adobe XD for end-to-end UX/UI design
