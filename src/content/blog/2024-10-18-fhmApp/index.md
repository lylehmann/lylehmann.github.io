The Fashion Design Museum App is designed to enhance the museum visitor experience by integrating physical exhibits with digital content. The app aims to personalize and enrich the visitor journey through interactive and self-guided tours, tailored content, and a seamless transition from on-site screens to mobile devices.

## The Challenge

Museum visitors often face several challenges:

- Difficulty in switching between physical exhibits and digital content.
- Overwhelming amount of information, making navigation and understanding challenging.
- Pressure to view all exhibits, leading to frustration and disinterest.

## Design Process

### Research and First Concepts

The initial phase involved collaborative efforts from the team to understand user needs:

- **Research:** Conducted interviews and surveys with museum visitors to gather insights into their challenges and preferences.

- **Ideation:** Brainstormed features that could address key challenges, such as seamless transitions, personalized content, and interactive learning.

### Mid-Fidelity Prototyping

The team developed mid-fidelity prototypes to test initial concepts:
Prototypes were created to visualize the app's functionality and user flow.
Testing with users helped refine ideas based on feedback and usability testing results.

### Internal conflicts

During the development process, the team encountered internal conflicts:

- **Conflicting Ideas:** Team members had differing opinions on how best to solve user problems, leading to debates over feature prioritization and design approaches.
- **Decision to Split:** To address these conflicts, the team decided to split responsibilities for high-fidelity (HiFi) versions of the app. This approach allowed for future A/B testing with users to determine the most effective solutions.

### Individual Contributions

#### High-Fidelity Prototyping

In my individual contribution, I focused on creating a unique HiFi version of the app:

- Renaming the App: I proposed rebranding my version as the Fashion Heritage Museum app. This change aimed to enhance branding clarity and differentiation by aligning the app's identity more closely with its focus on fashion history.

#### Unique Features Implemented:

- Developed a clearer and simpler user flow to improve navigation.
- Designed a light and dark mode feature, making it easier for users to read the app in varying lighting conditions within museum exhibition environments.

## Solution

The Fashion Design Museum App addresses visitor challenges by:

- **Seamless Transition:** Syncing touchscreens with the museum app via QR codes or NFC allows users to save and explore interacted content later.
- **Personalized Content:** Visitors can select specific themes or eras of interest. The system tracks preferences to recommend relevant content.
- **Self-Guided Tours:** The app offers personalized, self-paced tours using geolocation or AR functionalities for enhanced descriptions.

## Outcomes and Lessons Learned

- Enhanced visitor engagement by providing a cohesive digital experience that extends beyond the museum visit.
  Improved navigation of complex exhibits through personalized recommendations.
- Recognized the importance of aligning digital solutions with user preferences for a more intuitive experience.

## Future Improvements

- Expand personalization features to include more detailed visitor analytics for better content recommendations.
- Explore additional interactive technologies such as virtual reality (VR) for immersive experiences.
- Continue gathering user feedback to refine app functionalities and improve overall user satisfaction.
