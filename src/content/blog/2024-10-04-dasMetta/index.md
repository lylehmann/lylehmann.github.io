As part of the WBS Coding School bootcamp, I contributed to the UX design for Das Metta, a unique coffee shop, bakery, and yoga space in Munich, enhancing its online presence through a dedicated website and mobile app.

## The Challenge

Das Metta faced several challenges due to the lack of a dedicated website and mobile app:

- Limited online visibility and customer engagement
- Restricted ability to compete in today's digital marketplace
- Difficulty showcasing their unique combination of offerings
- Inability to provide detailed information about gluten-free and vegan options
- Lack of an online platform for yoga class bookings and product sales
- Absence of a mobile-friendly solution for on-the-go customers

## Design Process

1. **Research:** We conducted user interviews and surveys to understand the needs of Das Metta's diverse clientele, including yoga enthusiasts, vegans, and individuals with dietary restrictions.
2. **Ideation:** We brainstormed features addressing key challenges identified in the research phase.
3. **Prototyping:** Created low, mid, and high-fidelity wireframes and components in Figma for the website and mobile app.
4. **Testing:** We conducted user testing on initial designs to gather feedback.
5. **Iteration:** We refined designs based on user feedback and stakeholder input.

## Key Features

For the homepage and shopping sections, I focused on the following UX-centric features:

- **Engaging hero section** highlighting Das Metta's unique combination of cafe and yoga space
- Intuitive product **categorization and filtering** in the online store
- **Clear product descriptions** with emphasis on dietary information
- **Streamlined checkout process**
- **Responsive design** for seamless transition between desktop and mobile experiences
- Mobile-specific features such as **touch-friendly navigation** and **simplified layouts**

## Mobile App Conversion

### Task

Convert the existing website into a user-friendly mobile app to cater to on-the-go customers and increase engagement.

### Challenge

Adapting the comprehensive website content and functionality to a smaller screen while maintaining usability and performance.

### Approach

- Prioritized essential features for the mobile app
- Redesigned navigation for touch-based interaction
- Optimized content for mobile devices
- Implemented mobile-specific gestures for intuitive browsing
- Ensured consistency in branding and user experience across platforms

## Outcomes and Lessons Learned

- Created a user-friendly design for the website and mobile app, focusing on simplifying the user experience
  Improved visual hierarchy to guide users through content effectively
- Learned the importance of clear dietary information presentation for Das Metta's target audience
- Recognized the challenge of balancing comprehensive information with a clean, uncluttered design
- Gained insights into designing for a diverse user base with varying needs and preferences
- Developed skills in responsive design and mobile app UX principles

## Future Improvements

- Design a cafe rental system for events and workshops
- Implement user accounts for personalized experiences and order history
- Create a blog or resources section for wellness and nutrition content
- Develop a loyalty program to encourage repeat customers
- Integrate push notifications for promotions and class reminders in the mobile app
