As part of the WBS Coding School bootcamp, I contributed to redesigning the Lieferando app, focusing on improving the user experience for German food enthusiasts

## The Challenge

Lieferando's existing app faced several challenges that negatively impacted user experience:

- Confusing interface leading to user frustration and decreased usage
- Limited transparency regarding order status and delivery times
- Lack of real-time order tracking capabilities
- Removal of popular features like the Favorite Button and List in recent UI updates

## Design Process

1. **Research:** I conducted user research in iOS App Store, collaborated on Lean UX Canvas and survey and we analyzed features and performed SWOT analysis
2. **Ideation:** Created user journey and user flow diagrams, developed sitemap, we collaborated on persona creation and feature prioritization
3. **Prototyping:** Designed low-fidelity wireframes collaboratively, created mid-fidelity wireframes and components, developed high-fidelity prototypes and components
4. **Testing:** Conducted user testing on initial designs to gather feedback, iterated on designs based on user input

## Key Features

- Reintroduced **Favorite List & Button** for quick access to frequently ordered items
- **Updated Map and Live Tracking** for real-time order status updates
- **Live Chat with Customer Service** for immediate assistance
- **Streamlined user flow** to reduce steps in the ordering process

## Outcomes and Lessons Learned

- Created a user-friendly design for the homepage and shopping sections, focusing on simplifying the user experience
- Improved visual hierarchy to guide users through content effectively
- Learned the importance of clear dietary information presentation for Das Metta's target audience
- Recognized the challenge of balancing comprehensive information with a clean, uncluttered design
