BrushBuddy is a mobile app designed to support users in improving their oral hygiene routines. This project allowed me to apply user-centered methodologies and accessibility principles to create an engaging, inclusive digital solution for a common daily challenge.

## The Challenge

Many individuals struggle with:

- Maintaining consistent oral hygiene routines
- Staying motivated to brush for the recommended two minutes
- Navigating overly complex health management apps

## Design Process

1. **Research:** Interviewed and surveyed neurodivergent individuals
2. **Ideation:** Brainstormed features addressing key challenges
3. **Prototyping & Testing:** Created and tested low-, mid-, and high-fidelity wireframes
4. **Final Design:** Implemented a minimalist UI with music integration and gamification

## Key Features

- **Minimalist interface** to reduce cognitive load
- **Gamification** elements to encourage routine building
- **Customizable reminders**
- **Music** integration for an enjoyable experience

## Outcomes and Lessons Learned

- Created a user-friendly app focused on simplifying the brushing experience
- Improved user engagement and helped develop better oral hygiene habits
- Learned that not all users want an app assistant for brushing teeth
- Recognized potential as a therapeutic tool in combination with dental care
- Identified opportunity for health fund support to attract a larger user base

## Future Improvements

- Simplify language for greater inclusivity
- Expand survey to include open-ended questions and multiple languages.
- Focus on workflows rather than specific health conditions
